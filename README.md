* [**2.9.11elupatch1**](https://github.com/Elusive138/InstantFox/releases/tag/v2.9.11elupatch1): Fixes switch-to-tab bug in FF 35 (issue #1). 
* [**2.9.11.elupatch2**](https://github.com/Elusive138/InstantFox/releases/tag/v2.9.11.elupatch2): Fixes version number so official 2.9.11 does not automatically update over the patched version.
